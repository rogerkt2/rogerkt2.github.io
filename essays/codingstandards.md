## Can't Live in this World Without Standards

Everyone has standards. When it comes to eating, choosing what to wear, who to date, or what to do in the next five minutes, people will have their kind of guidelines for themselves. People's standards could be perceived as high, while some could be seen as low. I, myself, believe that my standards in life are pretty moderate. I do not expect too much from people or things, although my standards for my own coding are high.

Whenever I would code a program, I make sure that my code looks neat and easy to read. I check if the number of indents under all my loops or if-else statements are correct and consistent. In all honesty, I truly believed that the way I structured my code was supreme until I encountered ESLint.
