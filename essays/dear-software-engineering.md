## Looking Back
Without a doubt, ICS 314 is one of those classes where you would think back about and say, "Man, I really did learn a lot." With the semester ending, I believe I am a better person, socially and as a programmer. I learned new concepts and techniques with a chance to apply them all in my final project for ICS 314. 

## Coding Standards
Coding Standards is a concept that I learned and thought about throughout the semester. Coding standards impose rules on the way you write code. These rules focus on clarity and formatting. ESLint was a helpful tool that kept my coding standards in check. If I accidentally added an extra space, indent, or newline in my code, ESLint would scold me and prompt me to fix it. This practice of code format perfectionism is a good way of creating a baseline for me. This norm or baseline of making sure that my code looks good can be used further down in my career. Having coding standards is essential when working with other programmers in the industry. As a practice, I made sure that my code was well formatted while having variable name clarity when working with my group members on our final project.
