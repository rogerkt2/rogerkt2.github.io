# Dorm Tinder (Name in Progress)
## Problem and Solution

##### The Problem:
Finding a compatible roommate is a significant challenge for many students, both local and from out of state. Incompatibility in living styles, interests, and habits can lead to stressful living situations, affecting students' academic performance and overall well-being. Traditional methods of finding roommates, such as classified ads or social media groups, do not offer a reliable way to ensure compatibility between potential roommates.

##### The Solution:
Allow students to create detailed profiles that cover a range of preferences and use AI assistance to match students with the most compatible roommates. This algorithm will analyze profile information and offer options for students who would most likely enjoy living together.

## Mockup Page Ideas

The page would look quite similar to the digits page that we worked on for ICS 314. Instead of professors, the cards will display the most compatible roommates based on the user's preferences and/or interests. The site will have a navigation bar that brings you to pages where you can match with new possible roommates, view your matches, and view or edit your profile.

## Use Case Ideas
New users will go to the landing page, log in using a UH email, get the home page, and have the ability to set up their profile. Along with existing users, you can now travel to the matching page to search for a roommate with similar interests and preferences and contact them. Admin are able to go to the landing page, logs in, and edit the site.

## Beyond the Basics
- Implement AI for matchmaking.
- Sort or filter by gender, interests, on/off campus, neighborhood/location, major, etc. 
- Message interface. Receive a notification when you have been matched with a potential roommate, and be able to communicate on the site.
- Add listings for available housing and a rating system based on utilities, space, etc.
