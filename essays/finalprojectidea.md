# Dorm Tinder (Name in Progress)
## Problem and Solution

### The Problem:
Finding a compatible roommate is a significant challenge for many students, both local and from out of state. Incompatibility in living styles, interests, and habits can lead to stressful living situations, affecting students' academic performance and overall well-being. Traditional methods of finding roommates, such as classified ads or social media groups, do not offer a reliable way to ensure compatibility between potential roommates.

### The Solution:
Allow students to create detailed profiles that cover a range of preferences and use AI assistance to match students with the most compatible roommates. This algorithm will analyze profile information and offer options for students who would most likely enjoy living together.
