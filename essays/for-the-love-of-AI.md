### I. Introduction
From the start of college, the use of A.I. was strictly forbidden in every course I took. One small trace of A.I usage in your work and **BANG** your grade for that class or even your time as a college student is over. This taboo remained in all of my courses except ICS 314. In this course, we were encouraged to use A.I. in order to aid us with our software engineering work. In general, A.I. tools such as ChatGPT and Bard are useful for getting quick tips, instructions, or explanation on a certain topic.
