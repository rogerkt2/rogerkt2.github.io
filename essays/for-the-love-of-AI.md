### I. Introduction
From the start of college, the use of AI was strictly forbidden in every course I took. One small trace of AI use in your work and **BANG** your grade for that class or even your time as a college student is over. This taboo remained in all of my courses except ICS 314. In this course, we were encouraged to use AI in order to aid us with our software engineering work. In general, AI tools such as ChatGPT and Bard are useful for getting quick tips, instructions, or explanations on a certain topic. 

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs

Experience WODs (Workout-Of-The-Day) are assignments given to us that introduce new software engineering techniques. For most of these WODs, we were given a video that guided us on how to do the WOD correctly. Thanks to these videos, there was no point in using AI to help me. 

  2. In-class Practice WODs

In-class Practice WODs are a bit like the Experience WODs but a bit more difficult. Due to the similarities it has with the Experience WODs in regard to instructions, I could apply what I learned from the Experience WODs into the practice WODs. Again, I had no intention of using AI.

  3. In-class WODs

Now this is when I began to struggle. In-class WODs test students on their ability to apply what they learned from the Experience WODs and complete a difficult task in a certain amount of time. There were two instances where I felt like I really did not know what to do. Time was running out and the best chance at completing the task was to use AI. I used ChatGPT for both of the times I used AI, but for one of them, ChatGPT was not helping at all. I had a syntax error and ChatGPT kept on giving me a solution that resulted in the same error. With ChatGPT letting me down, I migrated to the Bard AI which solved my problem. From this experience, I learned that if you want the best possible solution to your problem, ask both ChatGPT and Bard. Compare their answers and see which one you understand better and which works best for you.
