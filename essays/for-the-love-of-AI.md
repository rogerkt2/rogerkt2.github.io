### I. Introduction
From the start of college, the use of AI was strictly forbidden in every course I took. One small trace of AI use in your work and **BANG** your grade for that class or even your time as a college student is over. This taboo remained in all of my courses except ICS 314. In this course, we were encouraged to use AI in order to aid us with our software engineering work. In general, AI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, and Grammarly are useful for getting quick tips, instructions, or explanations on a certain topic. 

### II. Personal Experience with AI:
I have used AI in class this semester in the following areas:

  1. Experience WODs

Experience WODs (Workout-Of-The-Day) are assignments given to us that introduce new software engineering techniques. For most of these WODs, we were given a video that guided us on how to do the WOD correctly. Thanks to these videos, there was no point in using AI to help me. 

  2. In-class Practice WODs

In-class Practice WODs are a bit like the Experience WODs but a bit more difficult. Due to the similarities it has with the Experience WODs in regard to instructions, I could apply what I learned from the Experience WODs into the practice WODs. Again, I had no intention of using AI.

  3. In-class WODs

Now this is when I began to struggle. In-class WODs test students on their ability to apply what they learned from the Experience WODs and complete a difficult task in a certain amount of time. There were two instances where I felt like I really did not know what to do. Time was running out and the best chance at completing the task was to use AI. I used ChatGPT for both of the times I used AI, but for one of them, ChatGPT was not helping at all. From what I remember, I had a syntax error and ChatGPT kept on giving me a solution that resulted in the same error. With ChatGPT letting me down, I migrated to the Bard AI which solved my problem. From this experience, I learned that if you want the best possible solution to your problem, ask both ChatGPT and Bard. Compare their answers and see which one you understand better and which works best for you.

  4. Essays

For all of the essays I have written in this class, I used AI. As of writing this reflection, I have realized that Grammarly is an AI tool. Grammarly helps keep the grammar in your essay in tip-top shape. When writing essays, I do not recommend AI to write the essay for you. I only used AI to check the grammar in my work.

  5. Final project

When we began working on the final project, my browser search history was basically all ChatGPT and Bard. AI was my right-hand man during this whole process of building a website. Building a website is fun, but it sure is frustrating at times when one thing is not working. With the help of AI, I was able to solve some complicated problems when working on the project. These problems are too specific for Google to help out. As of right now, I have an issue in the code that is too complicated for even AI to figure out. I asked both ChatGPT and Bard for tips and reasons, but to no prevail.

  6. Learning a concept / tutorial

Honestly, I only remember using AI to give me a quick definition of the concept of design Patterns. I had to write an essay about it, but I did not have time to watch an entire video on the concept. AI was able to give a good definition along with examples of what Design Patterns are.

  7. Answering a question in class or in Discord

During class discussions, our professor encourages us to use AI to answer given questions regarding aspects of software engineering. I was able to learn plenty due to AI's straightforward answers. When I would give it a list of questions, AI would return a list of answers.

  8. Asking or answering a smart-question

In the class Discord, people would submit smart-questions in a chat. I have to admit that when I see a question that was sent to the chat, I do not bother reading it. My mindset was that someone else could answer it or they would find the answer in time. I should stop this horrible mindset. I am currently working on a team project and that mindset that I had is unacceptable. I did not bother asking a question as well so no AI was used for this scenario.

  9. Coding example e.g. “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”

When using AI, I like to give it background information on what I am working on. For example, I wanted to create a leveling system for my final project. I would tell the AI what I want to do and some code of the project that correlates to what I am doing. In this case, I would give the AI the code that shows the user's profile. I would then ask AI how I could add a system where that calculates the user's level and displays it on their profile. Additionally, I would ask the AI for an opinion on whether I should create the function on the same file or a separate one. *I ended up doing it on a separate file*
