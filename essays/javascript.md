## My Experience

So far, my experience with learning and using Javascript is interesting. I am a complete beginner to this new language, but I do not struggle so much with understanding the syntax. Javascript kind of reminds me of Java which helped me go through the freeCodeCamp and ES6 courses. Out of all the languages that I learned, I feel like Javascript was the language that I quickly got used to. Sure there were some syntax that I had to scratch my head about, but with all the coding experience I got from my previous languages, I had no hard time.

## To be the Best Athlete

I like the concept of Athletic Software Engineering. It puts you into a competition with other fellow students to program a given prompt. In this competition, your fluency with Javascript is put to the test by having a time ranking. Basically, each student is in a race to see who completes the given prompt within a certain time limit. Athletic Software Engineering prepares students for their future careers. Workout-of-the-Day or WODs are a way of introducing students to Athletic Software Engineering. These WODs put students in a scenario where they would be in a coding interview.
