Video games, for some people, are a refuge to escape their mundane life. It gives you a rush of emotions, many good and sometimes bad. I was one of the people who sought refuge. To me, video games are a great way to take a break from the worries of life. Now that I am getting older, I have fewer opportunities to even play video games. This may sound unfortunate to me, but it forced a new enjoyable hobby into my life. Instead of playing video games, why not make them?

## Say Hi to Software Engineering

I was not fully introduced to the concept of Programming or Software Engineering until my senior year of high school. I was put into an introductory class to computer science and I was hooked. Who knew you could do so much with coding? My teacher had a big talk about game development and I decided I wanted to try that out. This was my first big dive into the world of software engineering. I had many attempts at creating my own game, but I was too lazy or busy with schoolwork. Now that I am deep into my second year of college, I am serious about game development.

## My Hope

There are many things that I want to improve about myself when it comes to coding or software engineering. I want to be able to clearly explain my code to my peers. I will soon be in a working environment that will require me to work alongside other software engineers. Lacking the ability to explain my code will infer that I do not even know what I am doing. I want to experience working in different companies to further improve my skills and knowledge of software engineering.
