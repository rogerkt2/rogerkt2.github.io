Although this is not a technical project, it is something that I enjoy doing a lot. I am not sure why my friends want me to build their skateboards for them, but I gladly take their request. With the limited tools I have, setting up a skateboard takes patience. When it comes to setting up my friend's boards, I make sure to set them up close to perfect.
