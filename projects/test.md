summary: "In the process of developing a game with a group of friends"
---

Around the middle of December 2023, a couple of friends and I decided to create a game development team. The team consists of five people. There are three programmers(myself included) and two artists. The game is being developed in C#.

## Development Progress

Game is still work in progress. Development is slower because all members are busy with coursework.
